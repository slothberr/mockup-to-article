# Mockup to Article

# Project Overview
This project practices HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website. 

# reflections.txt
When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in reflections.txt. Answer the following questions:
* What new skills have you learned?
* What has been easy?
* What has been difficult?
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
