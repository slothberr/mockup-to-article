You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 

Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
  * I learned three new skills: 
      - superscript, <sup></sup>
      - horizontal rule, <hr>
      - strikethrough, <strike></strike>
  * I came into this course with a basic knowledge of HTML, so a lot of this material so far has been a great refresher for me. 
  * Only difficult part so far is remember specific syntax, but that's what MDN Element Reference is for! :)
  * Using the MDN Element Reference was extremely helpful in completing the first project, especially in finding specific tags that I did     not know before.
